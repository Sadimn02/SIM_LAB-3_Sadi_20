# SIM_LAB-3_Sadi_20
Assignment_1----

Overview :
This project demonstrates basic matrix operations using Python. Two random 3×3 matrices are generated, and various mathematical operations are performed on them.

Features Implemented :
Generate two random 3×3 matrices.

Perform matrix:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication

Compute properties of a matrix:
Determinant
Inverse (if determinant ≠ 0)
Rank

Assignment_2----
Overview ----
This project performs matrix analysis using Python by modifying matrix values and observing how different mathematical properties change.

Features :
1. Vector Generation: Creates two independent vectors containing 15 random floating-point numbers each using numpy.

2. Data Visualization: Uses matplotlib to plot both vectors on a single graph for direct comparison, including custom axis labels, legends, and grid lines.

3. Scientific Computing: Utilizes sympy for potential symbolic matrix operations and seaborn for enhanced statistical data visualization.
